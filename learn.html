    <div class="founder-text">
      Rainbo was born in 2018 in my Toronto apartment after many transformative
      experiences with fungi, but the spores of awareness were planted much earlier.
      My journey with fungi first began in 2011 brewing mushroom tea and reconnecting
      to nature in the Canadian forests. It was in this season that I knew mushrooms
      would be with me for the rest of my life. They became and still are instrumental
      in my healing journey, and I know they can be for yours, too.
      <br><br>
      For many years I struggled with digestive issues and immune dysregulation.
      Mentally, I was anxious and in a constant cycle of stress and brain fog—in
      retrospect I was existing in a general state of disconnection. After failed
      attempts at feeling better via traditional western medicine, my world shifted
      as I adopted mind-body practices, changed my diet and began taking mushrooms
      functionally.
      <br><br>
      I created Rainbo to spread mushrooms to the masses and get people healthier and
      more deeply connected to nature. Mushrooms have shown me that whole-person
      healing is possible—that balance between all parts of ourselves and our social
      and natural environments is within grasp.
      <br><br>
      The great metaphor of what mushrooms represent in nature is both my—and
      Rainbo’s—raison d’être: resilience, cooperation, and the unfathomable magnitude
      of nature’s intelligence and interconnectedness. These fungal organisms contain
      some of the secrets to life as they network and weave wisdom into the collective
      consciousness.
      <br><br>
      I’m so happy our journeys have converged at this moment in time because now is
      the time. Thank you for being here and welcome to our Rainbo world.

  <!-- MANIFESTO -->
  <section class="intro">
    <h1>Our Manifesto</h1>

    <p>
      Because eventually, we’ll all go back to fungi.<br>
      This is our cosmic trip.
      <br><br>
      In through nature, out through nature. What we do in between is our calling.
      Because eventually, we’ll see there was no separation—only a collective chance
      for interdependence.
      <br><br>
      We are fungal advocates. We see the unseen and know the unknown.
      <br><br>
      We are human nature potentiators. The path forward to human and planetary
      health is ours to hold, nourish and remember.
